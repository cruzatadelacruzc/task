## Security Configuration for API with Google OAuth2 OIDC Integration

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
is configured with default settings, ensuring secure handling of cross-origin requests.

- CSRF protection is implemented using a cookie-based approach. The API employs a comprehensive CSRF strategy, handling tokens and requests through the security filter chain.

- Integration with Google OAuth2 OIDC to secure an API

## Testing and Coverage Setup

This project utilizes the JaCoCo plugin to ensure an 85% test coverage. Make sure to run tests regularly and review the coverage generated by JaCoCo.

## GraphQL

- GraphQL as a technology for performing efficient queries and operations on API resources


## CI/CD Setup
This project is configured for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions and Railway PaaS.
