## environment

- **Profile active: Production**

## Getting Started
#### API Information
##### Base URL
- [Base URL](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/)

#### Authentication
To authenticate, use the following URL:
- [Authentication URL](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/oauth2/authorization/google)

#### Resource Consumption
For consuming API resources, use the following URL:
- [GraphQL path:  */api/graphql*](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/api/graphql)


#### Account service
To obtain account information for the authenticated user, use the following URL:
- [GET request - route */api/account*](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/api/account)


## Security Configuration for API with Google OAuth2 OIDC Integration

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
is configured with default settings, ensuring secure handling of cross-origin requests.

- CSRF protection is implemented using a cookie-based approach. The API employs a comprehensive CSRF strategy, handling tokens and requests through the security filter chain.

- Integration with Google OAuth2 OIDC to secure an API

## Testing and Coverage Setup

This project utilizes the JaCoCo plugin to ensure an 85% test coverage. Make sure to run tests regularly and review the coverage generated by JaCoCo.

## GraphQL

- GraphQL as a technology for performing efficient queries and operations on API resources


## CI/CD Setup
This project is configured for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions and Railway PaaS.

## Metrics and Monitoring

This project utilizes Spring Boot Actuator to provide insights into the application's metrics and monitoring. Actuator exposes various endpoints that allow you to monitor the health, information, and metrics of your application.

### Actuator Endpoints

#### Without Authentication

- **Health Endpoint:**
  - [GET request - route `/management/health`](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/management/health)
  - Provides basic health information about the application.

- **Info Endpoint:**
  - [GET request - route `/management/info`](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/management/info)
  - Offers additional information about the application.

  - **Metrics Endpoint:**
  - [GET request - route `/management/metrics`](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/management/metrics)
  - Displays various metrics related to the application.

  #### Under Authentication
  
  - **Authenticated Metrics Endpoint:**
  - [GET request - route `/management/metrics`](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/management/metrics)
  - Provides detailed metrics accessible only to authenticated users.

  - **Authenticated Prometheus Endpoint:**
  - [GET request - route `/management/prometheus`](https://task-production-6048.up.railway.app/management/prometheus)
  - Offers Prometheus metrics with additional details for authenticated users.
